# ðŸ§® Object Counting and Tracking Project

This project demonstrates **real-time object detection, tracking, and counting** using [YOLOv11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and OpenCV.  
It includes two main applications:

- ðŸ‘¤ **Pedestrian Counting** â€“ detect and track people in a video
- ðŸš— **Vehicle Line Counting** â€“ detect and track vehicles, count how many cross predefined lines
